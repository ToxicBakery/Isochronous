# Isochronous
Sample app for Isochronous transfers on Android. Using JNA, a simple wrapper can be used to access otherwise unavailable Isochronous USB transfers on Android.

## Status
So far this is entirely untested past the point the app builds, installs, and some JNA appears to be executed. A more elaborate example will follow.
